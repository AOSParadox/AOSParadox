We will stand by what we had before.

==============================================================================================

**We are in search of people that would like to learn**

"So they're looking for what exactly? Under-skilled and under-appreciated developers? Someone help me understand please..."

We encourage people that have less knowledge than most developers, or are very new.
Because our team is young, we also encourage younger enthousiastes to come join us.
The team is not directly looking for forum users with recognition for their works,
but instead, users that have the heart, patience, and mind to help each other
achieve those titles. You can hit any of the GitHub members up through Hangouts. 
We look forward to seeing you!

==============================================================================================

**Why....?**

"This is funny as fuck!"

The team enjoys development as a hobby, why not share it to others that want to enjoy
it too? Our point is not to discourage those with titles already.

==============================================================================================

**What must you know already?**

You need to ..
- be able to communicate through Hangouts
- have a [Github](github.com) Account
- know how to push/pull/merge on git
- have a linux distro installed
- basic knowledge of how Android runs

==============================================================================================

**What kind of developers? Anyone that can contribute**

The main objective of the rom right now is to increase the support we can get for 
other devices. Those interested in "Device Tree" creation and maintenance are encouraged
to ask us. Those interested in "Kernel Tree" porting, optimizations, and maintenance are 
welcome. Those that are already app developers are also encouraged, but we cannot help in
that area because we have limited knowledge. Themers that can help materialize our rom
are just as encouraged.

==============================================================================================

**FUCK the haters**

Yes, we chose to use the profanity "FUCK" because it shows the intensity of how much we care
for this project. You must be thinking, what does "FUCK the haters" have to do with us caring
for this project?

"This is funny as fuck!"

We will not be stopped by those that put down our project. If a mistake is
made, then the team will take the fault as a team. We stand by each other.

"Another group of morons. Watch them be the next to be called out for kang."

BUT, if someone chooses to belittle our project based on assumptions, rumours, etc, 
we will disregard it and look ahead. We don't do this to prove anything to anyone.

"It says you have to be nice. I guess I'm fuckedï»¿"

There's a certain amount of respect that must be shown. The golden rule to that is
to "Do to others as you would have them do to you". Before anyone calls me a kanger
prematurely, this quote is taken from Luke 6:31 NIV. If someone treats you like shit,
that does not give you the right to do so back to them.

"I remember these clouns. There all moto g users that don't shut the fuck up. Ever."

Yes, and we will continue to do what we do. I find the above statement funny because
"Also, got to love the spelling errors BUT guess that goes with the whole (young or not) part :p"

We don't do it for assholes, we do this for ourselves and others to enjoy. Once you realize that,
maybe you'll look back at say to your self, "what the fuck was I thinking".

"Yes, do that. Step away, readjust and make sure to spend some time on your post. 
Like, make your vision clearer. Fuck assholes who think they can dev and but can't think about the 
fun of learning and teaching others. That's what I do. When someone comes at you like he did, remind 
them that this is a group for learning, and that means cherry-picking, merging features, etc. 
No one has ever learned android development without doing these simple things. As long as credit 
is given, it's none of his Fucking business." - a Recognized Developer

And lastly, we must give credit for the above quotes right? Yeah, we probably should.
