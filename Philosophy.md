The ROM's philosophy
====================

*What's the ROM goal and philosophy ?*
We want to make a CAF ROM as untouched as possible from the original AOSP. We don't want to add features. We don't want to optimize the ROM with sabermod/flags/tricks/hacks. We don't want to merge the latest R69 update, even if it's stable.
We want to make 100% profit from what CAF give us.

*What are the consequences ?*
Of course, as it is an opensource project, anyone can fork it and make his modifications on top of it.
HOWEVER, any publicly released based ROM need our agreement before beeing released.
We most likely will always allow any porting project AS FAR AS you respected the ROM principes that I'll enumerate right now :
- keep the overlay mentality (1 phone tree, the CAF chipset tree, the QCOM common tree and NO 3 phones tree + QCOM common tree)
- keep a clear and nice commit history
- keep the AOSP spirit (no "big" changes such as SlimLauncher, OmniGears, OmniSwitch, ...)
- keep credits to the original developpers that we are
- follow our "big" choices (no "DAT ULTRA OPTIMIZED LINARO+SABERMOD+O8+LOVE")
- do not kang our ROM
