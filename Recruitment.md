Recruitment
===========

**Who can take part of this project and who can't ?**

We aren't looking for **overskilled** devs.
We are looking for people *(young or not)* who seem motivated and **know what they do**.
To encourage this, here is the rule : the team won't get **any Reconized Developpers** (we won't recruite them, but agreed members are fully allowed to become *Reconized Memeber* of course)

**What kind of devs ?**

The *team* will count about 15~20 members (max), from **any country as long as they speak acceptable english** 
We need **kernel devs**,as well as **app developers**, as well as **device tree experts**. That's the 3 kinds of members we would like.
So **app devs** are welcomed too ! :D

**What do you need ?**

You need to ..
- be accessible by **Hangout Messaging App**
- have a [Github](github.com) Account
- Know things about using git.
- Be nice.
