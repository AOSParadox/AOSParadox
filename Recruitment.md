Recruitment
===========

**Who can take part of this project and who can't ?**

We aren't looking for **overskilled** devs.
We are looking for people *(young or not)* who seem motivated and **know what they do**.
To encourage this, here is the rule : the team won't get **any Reconized Developers** (we won't recruite them, but existing members are fully allowed to become *Reconized Developer* (XDA) of course)

**What kind of devs ?**

The *team* will count about 15~20 members (max), from **any country as long as they speak acceptable english** 
We welcome **kernel devs**,**app developers** as well as **device tree experts**.
So **app devs** are welcomed too ! :D

**What do you need ?**

You need to ..
- be accessible by **Hangout Messaging App**
- have a [Github](github.com) Account
- Know things about using git.
- Be nice.
