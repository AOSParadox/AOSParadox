Recruitment
===========

What are we looking for?

At the moment we are looking for relatively new developers that have a decent amount of skill and experience and know what they're doing. We mainly need kernel developers and device tree maintainers, but also app developers willing to learn about how to make a custom ROM may be accepted.

Which are the requirements to join the project?

The candidates must have a basic knowledge of how to use git, a github account and an acceptable level of English language proficiency. As they will have to remain in contact with the team and be added to the team's development chat on Hangouts, also a Google+ account is necessary.

**Update**

Time has flown. The team is now made and the first build has rollout.

We are having fun, and, as the orginal ROM's idea suggested, we learnt.
The ROM is a long term project.
