ROM Limits
==========


The ROM must be AOSP/CAF based.
We won't use any of **CM/OmniROM/LiquidSooth/EOS/AOPK/AOSPA/... stuff**.
But if the implement seems nice, we can pull it. But after reflexion.

Remember that we want to customize a ROM.
The only **hardware optimization will be on device tree or on the kernel**.

We will support as most devices as we can, but their Board need to be **supported by Codeaurora** we won't do it otherway.

We'll follow the CAF update. So the branches will be oftently updated.
