ROM Limits
==========


The ROM is AOSP/CAF based.
We don't use any of **CM/OmniROM/LiquidSmooth/EOS/AOKP/AOSPA/... stuff**.
But if the implementation seems nice, we can pull it. But after reviewing it.

Remember that we want to customize a ROM.
The only **hardware optimization will be on device tree or on the kernel**.

We will support as many devices as we can, but their Board need to be **supported by CanogenMod** we won't do it otherwise.

We'll follow the CAF update. So the branches will be updated often.
